# Study-Sync
I have designed a user-friendly website for study materials named Study-Sync, utilizing HTML and CSS. The website features a landing page that includes templates, images, animations, and information on study materials presented through cards using grid layouts. The site is built with responsive design principles, ensuring optimal functionality on both mobile devices and laptops, adapting seamlessly to different screen resolutions.
